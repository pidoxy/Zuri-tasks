# Reading Text Files Task

  The function should accept a filename as an argument and read the text contained in that file. It should return a string.

  Complete the function “count_words”. It uses “read_file_content” to read the text contained in “story.txt”. It should return a dictionary whose keys are unique words, and their values the count of those words in the text e.g {“as”:10, “would”:5}.
